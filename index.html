        <p>After a few delays and hours later, I made it to Hanoi! 
          The driver from the airport seemed to doze off a few times 
          while on the wheel... but no matter, I'm all in one piece :O. 
          The hotel staff were so kind to provide me with some tea and 
          freshly cut fruits upon my arrival at the lobby. It's been ages since I've
           eaten dragonfruit!</p>

          <p>After a refreshing shower,
            I decided to take to the streets and EXPLOORRRE. 
            Hanoi is really teeming with life, especially at night. 
            Oh and did I say the food was DELICIOUS!!?? Grilled fish, rice paper wraps, 
            spring rolls, fresh fluffy rice, I could have 
            everything twice over.</p>

          <p>So it's Lunar New Year and there were some awesome festivities on the streets 
            in Old Town Phuket. Check out these cool guys on stilts and unicycles! Wow! 
            And there was tons of street food to try out. Savoury dishes, 
            sweet ones, all you can imagine. Mmmmm.</p>
          <p>Also, the great thing about Old Phuket is that there are lots of affordable and nice places to stay.
            So if you're on a budget, you'd still find some awesome hotels that are fraction of what you'd pay elsewhere.

      <h1>Across the Sea: Energizing yet Tranquil Korea</h1>

      <article class="article">
        <p>What I love more than the sight of mountains and sea, is hiking :). 
          Busan is known for all of the above, so I decided why not check out 
          Seokbulsa Temple. I took a local bus which dropped me off at the 
          foothills of a mountain, about four kilometers away from the temple. 
          I thought, pssst, cinch, I've hiked way more. But damn those winding, 
          off-trail roads. There were moments where I felt, am I even going in the 
          right direction? </p>

          <p>In my panic I stopped over at a mini plaza in the middle of nowhere, 
            and I stepped in a home reno store that specializes in cupboards. 
            They were nice and friendly... and perhaps surprised to 
            see a random foreigner, sweating and out of breath to come out of 
            nowhere. One of the ladies searched on her computer and confirmed, 
            yes indeed I was heading in the right direction, and she pointed to where I should keep walking. Thank God for translaton apps.</p>
          <p>The more I walked and got over the inner anxieties, the more I felt at peace. 
            Even the cackling cicadas seemed more pleasant, as if telling me, you're almost there! 
            And alas there I was. After taking a few moments to breathe and close my 
            eyes, I felt an inner calm I haven't felt in a long time. My hunger ceased. I thought of my family, 
            and how not so long ago I felt so ill that I couldn't get out of bed. I clasped my hands
             together and prayed for being lucky to be here, to see the wonderful view and 
             ancient temple. I prayed for my family and friends to be well and happy. 
             I guess this was my own mindful, zen moment.</p>

      <h4>More, More, More!</h4>
      <img src="img/hanoi-food.jpeg"/>
      <p>I love fish and seafood, I'd have it every day if I could. 
        A friend asked me if I could give up meat. 
        I said sure, no prob... so long as I have my fish, shrimp, 
        squid and all the joys of the sea :D. This was from my first 
        meal in Hanoi when I arrived in the evening. Yes, yes and yes!</p>
      <img src="img/pineapple-rice.jpeg"/>
      <p>Fried rice is a go-to for me, it's always delicious, whether 
        for lunch or dinner. But to have it in a carved pineapple? 
        NO WAY! It looked so beautiful I didn't want to destroy it by 
        eating it. But this sentiment didn't last long... 
        done, devoured and digested ;)</p>

      <h4>Relaxing by the Sea</h4>
      <p>Ko Phi Phi has some of the most beautiful beaches with white sand and warm water.
        Yes lying down and sun-bathing is nice... but so is scuba diving! I'm glad to see
        Nemo reunited with papa.

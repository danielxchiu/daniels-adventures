            <p>Asia always seemed a world away. I'm originally from Toronto, and after years working at a miserable job,  
            I realized it is never too late to explore. 
            I thought to myself, with the money I had been spending on rent, living somewhere I didn't really want to be in,
            perhaps I could use these resources elsewhere? So decided to take the plunge into teaching by taking a CELTA course to teach English as a second language.
          I then applied to teach in South Korea, and I was fortunate to land a position with the Ministry of Education. I was placed in a countryside town in
        the Chungbuk province, where I would divide my work week between two elementary schools and one middle school. And so my adventure began... </p>
        
        <p>After three years in Korea, I was ready for the next challenge. And this brings me to Berlin. A friend
          in the countryside town I was living in, had suggested to me to apply for a master's program in Germany. So once again,
          I took a plunge and applied to HWR Berlin, and to my surprise, I was accepted to a program in International Security Management.
          And so the adventure goes on...
